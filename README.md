  The project utilizes the ANTLR4 library to generate parsers, interpreters, and tokens based on the "Grammar.g4" grammar file.
  </br>
  For generating the files related to grammar analysis, the Kali Linux operating system was used, running the command:
  </br>
  <div><pre><code> antlr Grammar.g4 </code></pre></div>
